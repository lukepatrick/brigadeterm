## Build

To build just type:

```shell
make build-binary
```

## Run

*At this moment the project is in alpha stage, there are no releases. You can build from source code.*

Brigadeterm uses kubectl configuration, so you need access to the cluster using kubectl.

```bash
brigadeterm --namespace {BRIGADE_NAMESPACE}
```

If you have problems with the rendering on your terminal try setting the `TERM` env var. For example:

```bash
TERM=xterm brigadeterm --namespace {BRIGADE_NAMESPACE}
```
