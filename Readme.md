## Run

First you need to download the binary from [releases][releases-url].

Brigadeterm uses kubectl configuration, so you need access to the cluster using kubectl.

```bash
brigadeterm --namespace {BRIGADE_NAMESPACE}
```

If you have problems with the rendering on your terminal try setting the `TERM` env var. For example:

```bash
TERM=xterm brigadeterm --namespace {BRIGADE_NAMESPACE}
```


## Build

To build just type:

```shell
make build-binary
```

Or use go directly:

```bash
go get -u github.com/slok/brigadeterm/cmd/brigadeterm/...
```
